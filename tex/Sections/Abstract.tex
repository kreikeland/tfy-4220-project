    This study aims to understand the motion of charged particles in Earths magnetosphere. In particular, we seek to understand the trajectories of charged particles from solar winds. This is done by modeling the Earths magnetic field as a dipole field, and then numerically solving the equations of motion for the charged particles. The simulations are performed using RK45 with different initial conditions.
