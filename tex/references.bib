abstract = {Recent measurements by earth satellites provide conclusive evidence that the magnetosphere of the earth is distorted by the solar wind, as has been predicted on theoretical grounds for some time. In the work reported here motions of charged particles trapped in the distorted magnetosphere were computed by using, as a model of the magnetosphere, the field of a weak magnetic dipole in the presence of a strong magnetic dipole. Drift paths through this field were calculated both for particles whose motion is confined to the magnetic equatorial plane and for particles mirroring at low altitudes. The paths of particles of various energies moving in the magnetic equatorial plane under the combined influences of field gradient-induced drift and field rotation were also calculated. It was found that, in the model used, the field rotation energizes trapped particles on the morning side and de-energizes them on the evening side of the earth. It is suggested that this effect must occur in any realistic model of the distorted magnetosphere and that it may play a role in the accumulation of the energetic particles that constitute the Van Allen zones.},
